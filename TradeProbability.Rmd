The goal of this analysis is to determine if we can improve upon weighted-midpoint (WMP) as an estimate for the fair value of a security. The main advantages to using WMP as a fair value estimate are:

- Simple to calculate
- Simple to understand
- Appears to be a good proxy for supply/demand

The main downsides are:

- Other potentially useful information is ignored
- Traders are likely to be more intelligent about order placement and won't display full size
- May not be as useful in pro-rata markets
